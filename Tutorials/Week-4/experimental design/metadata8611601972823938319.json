The profiles provide measures on a broad range of topics including: population, diversity, disadvantage and social engagement, housing, transport and education, health status and service utilisation, child and family characteristics and service utilisation. Rankings are provided to enable comparison of LGAs, along with the Victorian averages. The profiles are structured to provide a measure on each variable for each Local Government Area (LGA), and to also enable comparisons by providing rankings against all Local Government Areas as well as the Victorian measure. Profiles are also provided for former Department of Health regions, as well as the former Department of Human Services operational service areas and divisions.

A BMI of 25 and over, but below 30, is classified as pre-obese, while a BMI of 30, or over, is classified as obese. Note that studies comparing self-reported height and weight with actual height and weight indicate people tend to under-estimate their weight and over-estimate their height. Self-reported data is therefore likely to result in an underestimate of pre-obese and obesity in the community. It is also not possible to determine whether a high BMI relates to body fat or muscle, so a very muscular individual could be classified as overweight or obese.

Rates in the LGA profiles are crude rates; therefore, they are not comparable to those reported in the Victorian Health Information Surveillance System (VHISS), which are age standardised. ACSCs are those for which hospitalisation is thought to be avoidable with the application of public health interventions and early disease management, usually delivered in ambulatory settings such as primary care. High rates of hospital admissions for ACSCs may provide indirect evidence of problems with patient access to primary healthcare, inadequate skills and resources, or disconnection with specialist services. There has been a major change to the specifications for reporting of ACSCs since 2013�14, so that Victorian specifications are now consistent with the national definitions for Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations (PPHs), as specified by AIHW. Further details can be obtained from AIHW metadata http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/559032. Acute ACSCs include avoidable hospitalisations for acute diseases or conditions such as dehydration, gastroenteritis, kidney infection, perforated ulcer, cellulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ear, nose and throat infections and dental conditions. These conditions may not be preventable but theoretically should not result in hospitalisation if adequate and timely primary care is received.

ACSCs are those for which hospitalisation is thought to be avoidable with the application of public health interventions and early disease management, usually delivered in ambulatory settings such as primary care. High rates of hospital admissions for ACSCs may provide indirect evidence of problems with patient access to primary healthcare, inadequate skills and resources, or disconnection with specialist services. There has been a major change to the specifications for reporting of ACSCs since 2013�14, so that Victorian specifications are now consistent with the national definitions for Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations (PPHs), as specified by AIHW. Further details can be obtained from AIHW metadata http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/559032.

The HACC Needs Assistance Measure (NAM) target population encompasses 'older and frail people with moderate, severe or profound disabilities, and younger people with moderate, severe or profound disabilities'. The size and location of the preliminary HACC target population in Victoria is estimated from responses to Census questions on Need for Assistance with self-care, mobility or communication, counted at the local government area (LGA) level. The preliminary target population for each LGA is then adjusted by subtracting people in residential aged care as well as a proportion of DVA card holders. The rate per 1,000 indicates a relative need of service provision in different LGAs and this can be used to make comparison between LGAs in the relative extent of HACC provision compared to population. Because of the multiple occasions of service, it is possible for a given LGA to show more people getting a HACC service in a year than the count of individuals in the HACC target population. Comparison between years for a given LGA may be misleading if the number of clients is small. There was a major change in the methodology of how HACC target population (denominator) is calculated from 2013�14 onwards. As a result, rates per 1,000 target population from 2013�14 onwards are quite different from the rates in prior years. At the time of data collection, HACC was jointly funded by the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments. From 1 July 2016 significant changes have come into effect for the HACC Program, with the responsibility for funding and managing services for older people (65 years and over) transferred to the Commonwealth.
