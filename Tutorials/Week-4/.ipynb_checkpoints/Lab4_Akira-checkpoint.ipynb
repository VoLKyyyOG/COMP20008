    "\n",
    "### Regular Expressions (Regex)\n",
    "- Regular expressions allow you to match patterns in strings, rather than matching exact characters.  \n",
    "- For example, if I wanted to find all phone numbers with form `(03) xxxx xxxx`, where `x` is some arbitrary digit, then I could use a regular expression like this: \n",
    "    - `\\(03\\) \\d\\d\\d\\d \\d\\d\\d\\d` \n",
    "    - `\\(03\\) \\d{4} \\d{4}` where `\\d{4}` matches a digit exactly 4 times\n",
    "- Here's a good tutorial on Python regex: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp\n",
    "- and a website to test your regex expressions with test cases: https://regex101.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regex with Python\n",
    "- The `re` library in Python allows you to use regular expressions. \n",
    "- Methods of note are:\n",
    "    - `.search()` (search for a particular pattern given a string)\n",
    "    - `.findall()` (finds all substrings that match a given pattern)\n",
    "    - `.sub()` (replaces all matched substrings with another given substring)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Regex Quantifiers\n",
    "- `?`: exactly zero or one occurrences of the preceding element\n",
    "- `*`: zero or more occurrences of the preceding element\n",
    "- `+`: one or more occurrences of the preceding element\n",
    "- `{n}`: preceding item is matched exactly `n` times\n",
    "- `{,n}`: preceding item is matched up to `n` times inclusive\n",
    "- `{n,}`: preceding item is matched at least `n` or more times\n",
    "- `{m,n}`: preceding item is matched at least `m` or more times, but up to `n` times inclusive\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Escaping Special Characters\n",
    "- Like special characters in Python (i.e `\\n`), you will also need to escape special characters in regex.\n",
    "- For example, if you wanted to match a literal bracket `(`, you have to type `\\(` to escape it as `()` in regex is used to capture a literal group of characters\n",
    "    \n",
    "Consider the phone number from the example above."
