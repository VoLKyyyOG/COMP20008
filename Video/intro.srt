00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi all,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
today, we'll be covering the details -

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,250
of working as a team online

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,290
and how you might conduct standups.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,490
Just note that the we won't be covering all -

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,860
aspects of group work in this tutorial.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,320
Although standups are an efficient way of conducting - 

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,390
meetings, you should still conduct -

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,560
longer meetings that are purely focused on -

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,610
the actual project writing and analysis.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,860
Today, we'll be going through: Early Planning -

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,120
and Meeting Minutes,

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,320
some examples of online tools, 

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,080
and the basics of standups and kanban.

15
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,380
After this section, we'll also have -

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,000
a mock standup run by your fellow tutors!

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
So, Early Planning and Meeting Minutes.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
This step is strongly recommended for -

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,950
groups to do in their very first official meeting -

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,630
or as soon as possible.

21
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,850
For "early planning", your team -

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,890
should write down (in writing) -

23
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,020
about the allocation of tasks -

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,540
and responsibilities.

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,290
Your team must also -

26
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,570
all agree in writing.

27
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,600
For example, 

28
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,670
with everyone's full name and dates -

29
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,870
to make sure it is agreed upon.

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,070
(kind of like how you might sign a contract)

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
The initial plan is flexible, 

32
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,830
but should serve as a general guideline -

33
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,890
that your team can follow throughout -

34
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,260
the project's timeline.

35
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,540
And of course, if things need to be adjusted -

36
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,270
and changed, they can be.

37
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,000
(So long as your team is happy with it and they sign it off)

38
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,820
This initial plan combined with your -

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,810
minutes will serve as important -

40
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,760
evidence if there are any -

41
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,240
disagreements over contribution or workload.

42
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,060
Here's an example of a very basic Early Plan.

43
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,000
As you can see, 

44
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,160
we have the list of group members and -

45
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
a brief outline of each members' task -

46
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,230
allocation and commitments.

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
What are meeting minutes?

48
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Well, they're dot point summaries -

49
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,400
of what happened in the meeting.

50
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,460
And if the meeting was long or detailed,

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
then these minutes should summaries -

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,840
these additional notes as well.

53
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,470
Here's an example of a meeting minute. 

54
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,260
We have the time and members who attended,

55
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,459
as well as a dot point summary -

56
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,520
of the agenda that was covered.

57
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,760
It's supposed to be short, brief, and easy to read.

58
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,590
Now to the next section.


59
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,450
Online Collaboration Tools.

60
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,440
In terms of writing a report out collaboratively,

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,600
you should aim to use tools such as:

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,010
a shared Google doc or -

63
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,060
or Office or Overleaf

64
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,050
(if you're comfortable learning or using Latex)

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,100
...and this is the one I recommend.

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,250
Overleaf is a free online platform -

67
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,830
which allows live collaboration for latex reports.

68
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,330
Latex is a markup language -

69
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,470
(much like HTML and markdown)

70
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,870
and is the most common way -


71
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
of writing up reports in industry -

72
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,290
or for research.

73
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,080
In fact,

74
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,140
many of your assignments and -

75
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,170
lecture slides that you get at the -

76
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,040
university, are actually written in Latex.

77
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,150
Now, in terms of keeping track -

78
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,180
of your teams progress between the -

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,330
standups, there are a plethora -

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
of communication and collaborative -

81
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,360
tools, such as:

82
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,090
Discord or Slack,

83
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,110
Online spreadsheets,

84
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,810
your Canvas Group Page,

85
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
checking Git Commits and Issues,

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
and finally, Kanban boards

87
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,480
(which we will cover in a bit)

88
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,100
We will now introduce the concepts of -

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
a standup, which is an -

90
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,140
"agile" work methodology that -

91
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,920
that industry teams follow when -

92
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,970
working from home or working remotely.

93
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,990
Especially during COVID, where -

94
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
many businesses have transitioned into the -

95
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,090
working from home (WFH) lifestyle,

96
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,470
important that you have some experience -

97
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,060
and at least an attempt at -

98
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,160
maintaining some form of online team work using standups. 

99
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,710
This will not only be beneficial for your -

100
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,770
university projects, but will also -

101
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,830
serve as an important skill that you -

102
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,850
chuck down on your resume -

103
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
or discuss during your interview.

104
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,600
So, Part 3. 

105
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Standups and Kanban.

106
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,620
So, what is a standup? 

107
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
In many American sports such -

108
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,400
as football and rugby,

109
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,890
the team has a huddle before each play. 

110
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,090
The huddle is short and strategic.

111
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,030
It keeps the team informed,

112
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:33,900
connected,

113
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,930
and calibrated throughout the game. 

114
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,910
For software teams,

115
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,210
the standup is much like a team's huddle,

116
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,730
and we usually refer to this as a "scrum meeting".

117
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,580
In other words, 

118
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,630
scrums are a daily meeting that -

119
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,670
involves the core team; such as your -

120
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,780
project managers,

121
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,790
your clients, and developers.

122
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,710
For your group project,

123
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,940
 this will just be all the team members. 

124
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,140
Although standups can vary -

125
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,360
across different teams and corporations,

126
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,170
we usually have 3 very simple questions -

127
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,320
that each person takes in turns to answer. 

128
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,720
1. What work have I completed since the last standup? 

129
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,780
2. What new tasks can I work on until the next standup? 

130
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,610
and 3. What issues came across that are blocking my progress? 

131
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,560
Standups are supposed to be kept short and efficient, 

132
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,490
so each person usually spends -

133
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
no more than a couple minutes talking.

134
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,790
Hence a standup,

135
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,850
you stand up and give a short talk.

136
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,680
It's also strongly recommended -

137
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,710
that you have someone on rotation -

138
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,830
every standup to write your meeting minute,

139
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,300
so you don't have to "remember" or "make them up" later.

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,010
Kanban Boards.

141
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,460
Now that we have covered the basics -

142
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,670
of a standup,

143
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
let’s move onto Kanban boards -

144
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,050
within the context of Agile work methodology.

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,870
Kanban, is actually a Japanese term -

146
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,980
for billboard.

147
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,150
And in the context of Agile,

148
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,410
Kanban boards have tasks that are - 

149
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,560
represented visually as a card on the board,

150
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,580
allowing all team members to see the -

151
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,550
progress of each task at any time.

152
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,750
Now, to the right here, you can see -


153
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,950
an example of a kanban board with - 

154
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,150
 several tasks and cards.

155
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,490
There are usually 4 cards, 

156
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,660
but here, we also have a 5th card for -

157
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,120
 "URGENT" which denotes a task -

158
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,770
that needs to be completed as soon as possible.

159
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,970
Now going through this, you'll -

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
notice we have a "TODO" section.

161
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,670
These tasks here, such as -

162
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,330
Report Error Analysis, Report Discussion,

163
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,390
these have yet to be started.

164
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,590
"In Progress", we've got -

165
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,800
a couple tasks here;

166
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,370
such as Visualization,

167
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,710
Report Methodology,

168
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,880
Initial Results,

169
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
these are tasks that are currently -

170
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,390
being completed.

171
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,550
And "URGENT", these tasks -

172
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,670
must be completed -

173
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,120
as soon as possible.

174
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,100
It usually means there's a deadline or -

175
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,130
other tasks rely on this one -

176
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,010
to be completed.

177
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,210
And finally, we've got "BLOCKED".

178
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,510
These, are a list of tasks -

179
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,630
where you cannot start them -

180
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,690
until another task has finished.

181
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,470
And there we go,

182
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,490
"COMPLETED" on the side, where these -

183
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,350
are just a list of your completed tasks.

184
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,190
In a Kanban board, tasks -

185
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,700
are broken down into four main categories.

186
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,400
Tasks to do,

187
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,990
tasks in progress,

188
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,940
tasks that are blocked,

189
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,140
and tasks that are completed.

190
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,370
Whenever you generate tasks in a standup,


191
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,570
 you add them to "to do".

192
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,770
When you start your task, 

193
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,969
you move that task to "in progress".

194
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,070
And if your task is "blocked" by -

195
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,890
someone else, 

196
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
for example, it relies on another -

197
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,980
person to finish their task,

198
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,180
then you move it to "blocked" .

199
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,590
That is, your tasks' progress is

200
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,570
blocked until the prerequisite task is completed.

201
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,770
When you finish your task, you can -

202
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,810
then add it to "completed" .

203
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,050
Kanban boards can be make-shift, 

204
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,150
so you can use existing tools such as;

205
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,460
Google Sheets,

206
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,340
your Group Space in Canvas,

207
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
or Atlassian's JIRA, which is -

208
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,910
what we'll be using in today's mock standup.

209
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,110
You can also use a physical -

210
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,060
whiteboard or wall, and have -

211
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
sticky notes and move them physically.

212
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,350
(if that's how you would like to do it)

213
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,890
Now that we've gone through all the foundational concepts, 

214
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,419
let's go into a mock example of a tri-weekly standup with a Kanban board.
